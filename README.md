The purpose of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of Capomulin at reducing the size of squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) by comparing it to a range of different drug regimens. The study included a total of ten different drug treatment programs over a 45 day study that consisted of 249 mice. The mice were nearly an even split between male (51%) and female (49%) populations to apply nearly an equal weighting between the different sexes. The analysis uses several statistical analysis methods and various type of plots to better understand the data from Pymaceuticals, Inc.
